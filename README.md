# ToDoWithVue

A to do list that stores your notes in the local storage. This is my first ever vue project and i am very satisfied with it. I only did the basics things you can do in vue so I haven't really touched props or emeting stuff which hopefully i will do in the next project which will be very epic.


## Just Quick Few Heads Up

- styles go weird when using mozilla fox
- ~~no mobile view~~ now with mobile view
